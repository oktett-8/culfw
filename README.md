# culfw for cul devices
___
**The original firmware tree is cloned from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/p/culfw/code/commit_browser).**

_This fork is intended to upgrade the original culfw repository to the firmware found at [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/p/culfw/code/commit_browser) to be used for future patches. Original purpose is the fix of nanoCUL crashes for **wMBus** (switch to branch O8-r571wmbus). However, the master branch contains the complete source tree up to r571 at SourceForge._
